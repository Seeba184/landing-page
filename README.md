# landing-page

This project will be creating a landing page using this design: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png. I will have demonstrated how to use CSS and its various concepts such as setting classes and using the box model. I will also show proficiency in using Flexbox and how to position elements on the webpage.
